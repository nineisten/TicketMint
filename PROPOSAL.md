# TicketMint Proposal and Roadmap 

## Executive Summary
TicketMint is a revolutionary ticketing platform built on the QUBIC blockchain, leveraging Useful Proof of Work (UPoW) to deliver secure, transparent, and collectible NFT-based event tickets. Users can create events, mint tickets as NFTs using QUBIC tokens or bank cards, transfer tickets securely, and verify single-use tickets at events via QR/NFC scanning. Smart contracts ensure automated revenue sharing for event organizers and TicketMint token holders, while anti-scalping controls maintain fair pricing. With a $500,000 seed investment, TicketMint aims to develop and launch a scalable platform, targeting the $20 billion global ticketing market with a blockchain-driven solution that eliminates fraud, enhances fan engagement, and creates new revenue streams.

## Market Opportunity
- **Market Size**: The global event ticketing market is projected to reach $20.1 billion by 2026, driven by demand for secure, accessible ticketing solutions.
- **Pain Points**: Fraudulent tickets cost the industry $4 billion annually, while scalping inflates prices and erodes trust. Traditional tickets lack post-event value, and organizers lose control over secondary sales.
- **Blockchain Advantage**: NFT ticketing, as seen in projects like GET Protocol and Cometogether, reduces fraud and enables royalties, but lacks broad accessibility due to crypto-only payments.
- **TicketMint’s Edge**: Hybrid QUBIC/fiat payments, QUBIC’s low-cost UPoW blockchain, and revenue-sharing smart contracts position TicketMint to capture market share by serving both crypto and non-crypto users.

## Value Proposition
TicketMint offers:
- **Fraud-Proof Tickets**: NFT tickets on QUBIC’s blockchain ensure authenticity and prevent counterfeiting.
- **Flexible Payments**: Users pay with QUBIC or bank cards, broadening accessibility.
- **Controlled Resales**: Smart contract rules (e.g., price caps, royalties) curb scalping and ensure organizer profits.
- **Collectible Value**: NFT tickets serve as digital keepsakes, enhancing fan engagement.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Automated distribution of proceeds to organizers and token holders via QUBIC smart contracts.
- **Scalability**: QUBIC’s UPoW ensures low-cost, high-throughput transactions for large-scale events.

## Target Customers
- **Event Organizers**: Promoters, venues, and conference hosts seeking secure ticketing and secondary market control.
- **Attendees**: Fans wanting authentic, collectible tickets with seamless purchasing.
- **NFT Collectors**: Users trading event-based digital assets.
- **QUBIC Users**: Crypto enthusiasts leveraging QUBIC for real-world applications.

## Technical Approach
- **Blockchain**: QUBIC, using UPoW for scalable, low-cost NFT minting and transfers.
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom contracts for ticket minting, resale rules, and revenue distribution (audited for security).
- **Payment Integration**: Third-party gateways (e.g., MoonPay, Stripe) for fiat-to-QUBIC conversion, ensuring compliance with KYC/AML regulations.
- **Wallet System**: Custodial TicketMint wallet for non-crypto users and support for external wallets (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Verification**: QR/NFC-based scanning at events, linked to blockchain for single-use validation.
- **Frontend**: Web and mobile apps (iOS/Android) for event creation, ticket purchasing, and wallet management.
- **Backend**: Scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS) for high transaction volumes.
