# Lean Canvas for TicketMint

## Problem
- **Ticket Fraud and Counterfeiting**: Traditional ticketing systems suffer from fake tickets, causing financial losses and attendee frustration.
- **Scalping and Unauthorized Resales**: Scalpers inflate ticket prices, limiting accessibility for genuine fans.[](https://cometogether.network/understanding-nft-ticketing/)
- **Lack of Post-Event Value**: Traditional tickets become worthless after events, missing opportunities for collectible or engagement potential.
- **Opaque Revenue Distribution**: Event organizers lose control over secondary sales and associated profits.
- **Crypto Accessibility**: Cryptocurrency-based ticketing is often complex for non-crypto users, limiting adoption.

## Customer Segments
- **Event Organizers**: Concert promoters, festival planners, sports event managers, and conference hosts needing secure ticketing.
- **Event Attendees**: Fans seeking authentic, fraud-proof tickets with added value (e.g., collectibles).
- **NFT Collectors**: Users interested in owning and trading event-based digital assets.
- **QUBIC Ecosystem Users**: Crypto enthusiasts and investors using QUBIC tokens for practical applications.
- **Secondary Market Traders**: Individuals or platforms reselling tickets under controlled conditions.

## Unique Value Proposition
TicketMint delivers secure, transparent NFT-based event ticketing on the QUBIC blockchain, enabling QUBIC or bank card payments, controlled ticket transfers, single-use verification, and automated revenue sharing for organizers and token holders, all powered by QUBIC’s scalable UPoW consensus.

## Solution
- **NFT Ticket Minting**: Organizers create events on TicketMint and mint tickets as NFTs on QUBIC’s blockchain, ensuring authenticity.
- **Flexible Payments**: Users pay with QUBIC tokens or bank cards (via third-party gateways like MoonPay), converted to QUBIC for NFT minting.
- **Wallet Integration**: Tickets are minted as NFTs and sent to a user’s QUBIC-compatible wallet (e.g., TicketMint’s custodial wallet or external wallets like MetaMask).
- **Single-Use Verification**: At events, tickets are scanned via QR codes or NFC, verified on the blockchain, and marked as used to prevent reuse.
- **Smart Contract Revenue Sharing**: QUBIC smart contracts distribute a percentage of ticket sale proceeds (primary and secondary) to organizers and TicketMint token holders.
- **Anti-Scalping Controls**: Organizers set resale rules (e.g., price caps, royalty percentages) via smart contracts to curb scalping and retain profits.

## Channels
- **TicketMint Website**: Core platform for event creation, ticket minting, and purchases.
- **QUBIC Ecosystem**: Promotion via QUBIC community channels, wallets, and partnerships.
